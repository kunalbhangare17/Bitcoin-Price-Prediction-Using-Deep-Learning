# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning

## Bitcoin Price Prediction with RNN and LSTM in Python

Here we develop a price prediction model using the historical bitcoin price data set. 
We use the RNN and LSTM algorithms to find the price prediction.

## The steps used in this project are:
1. Data Collection:
2. RNN for 1D:
3. Normalize the data sets
4. LSTM Model
5. Define the number of epochs to 10
6. De-Normalization is done for plotting
7. Performance Measure RMSE is calculated for the predicted test dataset
8. Finally predicted values are visualized
